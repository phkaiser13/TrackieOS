## ✨ Key Features

-   **Optimized Kernel:** Built from the ground up for maximum performance with minimal resource usage.
-   **Extremely Lightweight:** Features a remarkably low memory footprint, making it ideal for hardware-constrained systems.
-   **Integrated APIs:** Includes native APIs to securely and efficiently manage updates and perform version checks for the Trackie ecosystem.
-   **Single-Purpose Focus:** The entire OS is streamlined to serve a primary application, eliminating unnecessary background processes and services.

## 🚀 Performance

In our benchmark tests, TrackieOS demonstrated outstanding performance. The system's RAM consumption remained stable within a **40-70 MB** range.

These tests were conducted on the following hardware:
-   **Raspberry Pi 3B** (1GB RAM)
-   **Orange Pi 3** (8GB RAM) (The Current device chosen for raspway)
-   **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W** (512MB RAM)

## 💻 Compatibility

TrackieOS is currently compatible with a lot of arm embedded systems, inclu:

*The list of supported devices will be expanded in the future.*
